# Finding Donors for CharityML

This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Term 1. The task is to leverage supervised learning algorithms to identify potential donors to the ficticious charity CharityML.

## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries available through the Anaconda package.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This project is part of the work required by the Data Science Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity. The idea behind this implementation is to better understand the different supervised machine learning algorthims and to practice identifying the most useful one for specific scenarios.
* Question 1: Naive Predictor Performance
* Question 2: Model Application
* Question 3: Choosing the Best Model
* Question 4: Describing the Model in Layman's Terms
* Question 5: Final Model Evaluation
* Question 6: Feature Relevance Observation
* Question 7: Extracting Feature Importance
* Question 8: Effects of Feature Selection

## File Description <a name="description"></a>
There is one Jupyter notebook containing the code to answer the above questions. Markdown cells were used to help understand the different steps taken and some theory behind the supervised learning models. There is also an html version of the Jupyter notebook in this repo.

## Results
The overall result of the analysis was that AdaBoost had the best accuracy and was the most appropriate model from a variety of investigated models to predict donors.
